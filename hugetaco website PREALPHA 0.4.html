<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:white">Hello reader! You've stumbled across Daniel's hypertext page. This site is where I will, or, where I hope to, post stuff 
about various things, including but not limited to:
<br>Things going on in my life (which most of you probably won't care 
about anyways)
<br>Tropical weather updates
<br>Other stuff soon to come

<h3 style="font-family:helvetica; color:white; text-align:center">Why create a website?</h3>
<p style="font-family:helvetica; color:white">The whole reason why I created this website is because I am currently learning HTML. For those of you who don't know,
HTML is a programming language used to organize and present raw text. Thus, it is the coding language used for designing 
websites (along with CSS, Javascript, etc). This entire website will be hand-coded by me. That means all of the fonts,
colors, locations of words and pictures on your screen were not dragged and dropped and selected using a website editor.
All of those little features had to coded by hand by me. To give you a perspective, here is a screenshot of some of the 
raw HTML code for this very website (insert picture)
Now, by no means am I saying that HTML is hard. Actually, it's probably the easiest programming language that one can learn.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that coding a website by hand is a lot more work. So, I'm really just trying to show off.</p>
